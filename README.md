# King County Housing Data


## Overview

This project takes a look at housing data for King County in the state of Washington. The student notebook follows the OSEMN framework (Obtaining, Scrubbing, Exploring, Modeling, and Interpretting the data) to see what features of a house will help predict the selling price.

## Objectives
I explored 3 questions in the data:

* What are the unique features of the most expensive houses?
* How do houses built after the year 2000 compare to houses built before 2000?
* Which season of the year is best for buying? Which season of the year is best for selling?

I iterated through the different house features and settled on a model with features that predict the cost of the house.
